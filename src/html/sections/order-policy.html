				<h1>Order and Return policy</h1>
				<p>
					Each piece offered at noirgold.art is made with intention and selected with care. Once your order is placed, it enters a
					secure and considered process. You will receive a confirmation email, followed by a shipping notice with tracking details when your piece is on its way.<br>
					We do not offer mass production. As a result, availability is limited, and all sales are considered final. Please review your selection carefully before completing your order.<br>
					In the rare case that an item arrives damaged or incorrect, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery at
					support@noirgold.art, including photographs and your order number. Each case will be handled individually and with
					attention. If accepted, a replacement or store credit may be offered. Return shipping is the responsibility of the
					client, unless otherwise stated.<br>
					We do not accept returns based on change of mind, personal taste, or sizing unless otherwise clearly stated on the product page. For this reason, we encourage mindful selection.<br>
					NoirGold is not fast fashion. It is a conversation between the creator and the initiated. Thank you for understanding
					the nature of our work.
