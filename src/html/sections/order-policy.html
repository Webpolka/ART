				<h1>Order and Return policy</h1>
				<p>
					Each piece offered at noirgold.art is made with intention and selected with care. Once your order is placed, it enters a
					secure and considered process. You will receive a confirmation email, followed by a shipping notice with tracking
					details when your piece is on its way. We do not offer mass production. As a result, availability is limited, and all
					sales are considered final. Please review your selection carefully before completing your order. <wbr>
					In the rare case that an item arrives damaged or incorrect, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery at
					support@noirgold.art, including photographs and your order number. Each case will be handled individually and with
					attention. If accepted, a replacement or store credit may be offered. Return shipping is the responsibility of the
					client, unless otherwise stated. We do not accept returns based on change of mind, personal taste, or sizing unless
					otherwise clearly stated on the product page. For this reason, we encourage mindful selection. <wbr>
					NoirGold is not fast fashion. It is a conversation between the creator and the initiated. Thank you for understanding
					the nature of our work.
