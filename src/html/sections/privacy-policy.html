				<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
				<p>
					At noirgold.art, your privacy is not just respected—it is protected with the same care and intention that we bring to
					everything we create. When you interact with our site—whether making a purchase, creating an account, or subscribing to
					updates—you may share personal information such as your name, email address, shipping details, and contact information.
					Payment data is processed securely by trusted third-party services and is never stored on our servers.<br>
					We also collect non-personal data, including your device type, browser, IP address, and your activity on the site, to help us better
					understand how our visitors engage with our content and to ensure a seamless experience.<br>
					This information is used solely	to process your orders, respond to inquiries, improve the site, and—if you choose—to share occasional updates. We never
					sell your information or pass it to advertisers. In rare cases, we may share necessary data with trusted partners, such
					as payment processors or shipping services, but only to complete the services you’ve requested.<br>
					Cookies are used to	remember your preferences, support account functionality, and analyze performance. You may disable cookies in your
					browser settings, though this may affect some features of the site.<br>
					Your data is stored securely. We take measures to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of your information. If you wish to access, correct, or delete your data,
					simply email us at support@noirgold.art. You are always in control of the information you share with us.<br>
					By using noirgold.art, you consent to this privacy policy. Should we make changes in the future, they will be reflected on this
					page. We encourage you to revisit it from time to time.<br>
					When you choose to proceed with us, you extend your trust—and we safeguard that trust as quietly and precisely as the pieces we craft.
